Org-Pomodoro
============

This adds very basic support for
[Pomodoro technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/)
to Emacs' org-mode.

With default options:

You can start a pomodoro for the task at point or select one of the
last tasks that you clocked time for. Each clocked-in pomodoro
starts a timer of 25 minutes and after each pomodoro a break timer of
5 minutes is started automatically. Every 4 breaks a long break of 20 
minutes is started. All values are customizable.

Installation
============

 Install from MELPA:

 * Add MELPA to your EMACS installation:

         (add-to-list 'package-archives
                      '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)

 * Install the package via `M-x package-install RET org-pomodoro`

Usage
=====

 1. Move point to a task as you would do with `org-clock-in`.
    Call `org-pomodoro` the task will be clocked-in.
 2. When it's time for break, the task will be `org-clock-out`'ed
 3. If you call `org-pomodoro` during a pomodoro, you'll be asked to reset
    a pomodoro.
 4. If you call `org-pomodoro` outside org-mode, you'll be presented
    with list of recent tasks, as `C-u org-clock-in` would.

Customization
=============

Most aspects of `org-pomodoro` can be customized. Examples are the
length of pomodoros and breaks (`org-pomodoro-length`,
`org-pomodoro-short-break-length`, `org-pomodoro-long-break-length`),
sounds, modeline display, if breaks should be clocked
(`org-pomodoro-clock-break`) the behaviour when a pomodoro is reset
(`org-pomodoro-ask-upon-killing`, `org-pomodoro-keep-killed-time`)
etc. Have a look at the `org-pomodoro` customization group.

Some workflows benefit from the option to work a few minutes
“overtime” to finish a task before taking a break (that is, a slightly
dynamic pomodoro time). The option `org-pomodoro-manual-break` enables
this workflow, where a break notification is sent at the end of the
pomodoro time but the break is started first when manually calling
`org-pomodoro`.
